# Real-World Use Cases of Formal Verification

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Goal:** Understand where formal verification is used (before and beyond AI)

**For:** Developers, not researchers

---

## 1. Why Real-World Systems Need Guarantees

Some systems cannot afford "mostly correct".

If they fail:
- Money is lost
- Security is broken
- Laws are violated
- Lives may be at risk

In such systems, **testing is not enough**.  
They need **guarantees**.

---

## 2. Compilers (Software Developers Already Use This)

A compiler translates code into machine instructions.

**If a compiler is wrong:**
- Correct programs produce wrong results
- Bugs appear in every app

**So parts of compilers are formally verified.**

**Goal:**
> For any valid program, the generated machine code follows the language rules.

This is formal verification in action.

**Examples:** CompCert (verified C compiler), seL4 (verified OS kernel)

---

## 3. Cryptography & Security Systems

Encryption systems must follow strict mathematical rules.

**If even one rule breaks:**
- Data leaks
- Security collapses

Testing random cases is not enough.

**Formal verification is used to:**
- Verify protocols (TLS, SSH)
- Prove key properties (no leakage, no bypass)

**Examples:** Amazon s2n (TLS), HACL* (crypto library)

---

## 4. Aerospace & Safety-Critical Systems

**Examples:**
- Aircraft control software
- Spacecraft navigation
- Railway signaling systems

These systems must behave correctly in **all conditions**.

**Formal verification proves:**
- Safety constraints
- Correct state transitions
- No illegal behavior

**Real incidents:**
- Ariane 5 rocket explosion (1996) - integer overflow
- Could have been caught by formal verification

---

## 5. Hardware Design (CPUs & Chips)

Modern CPUs are extremely complex.

**A single logic bug can:**
- Crash systems
- Create security vulnerabilities (Spectre, Meltdown)

**Chip designs are formally verified to ensure:**
- Logic correctness
- Timing guarantees
- No invalid states

**Examples:** Intel, AMD verify critical CPU components

---

## 6. Finance & Business Rules

**Examples:**
- Tax calculation systems
- Payment settlements
- Banking rules

**If rules break:**
- Money goes missing
- Legal issues arise

**Formal verification ensures:**
- Business rules are always followed
- Constraints are never violated

**Example:** London Stock Exchange uses formal methods for trading systems

---

## 7. What Changed With AI

AI systems (LLMs) generate outputs **probabilistically**.

This introduces new risks:
- Hallucinations
- Rule violations
- Inconsistent reasoning

**Traditional systems used deterministic logic.**  
**AI does not.**

**This is the problem.**

---

## 8. Why AI Now Needs Formal Verification

**LLMs are used for:**
- Code generation
- Data processing
- Decision support
- Automation

**But LLMs:**
- Cannot prove correctness
- Cannot guarantee constraints

**So we add a deterministic layer.**

---

## 9. AI Use Cases That Need Verification

**Examples:**
- SQL queries generated by LLMs
- Financial calculations
- Access-control logic
- Compliance checks
- Workflow automation

**Here, one wrong output is unacceptable.**

---

## 10. How QWED Applies Formal Verification to AI

QWED sits **outside** the model.

**Flow:**
```
LLM output → QWED verification → accept or reject
```

**QWED checks:**
- Logical rules
- Constraints
- Deterministic properties

**The LLM is never trusted blindly.**

This is the **untrusted translator** pattern:
- LLM translates (English → Math/Logic)
- QWED verifies (Math/Logic → Proof)

---

## 11. Important Point

**Formal verification does NOT replace AI.**

It:
- Limits AI behavior
- Enforces correctness
- Makes systems predictable

**AI remains creative.**  
**Verification remains strict.**

---

## 12. Key Takeaway

Formal verification exists because:
- Testing cannot cover everything
- Probabilistic systems cannot give guarantees

**As AI enters critical systems, formal verification becomes necessary.**

This course shows **how to apply it practically using QWED**.
