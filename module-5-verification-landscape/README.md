## 5.1: The Verification Zoo

### The Problem Space

When you deploy LLMs in production, you need to ensure outputs are:

1. **Safe** - Won't cause harm
2. **Accurate** - Factually correct
3. **Compliant** - Meets regulations
4. **Consistent** - Reproducible results

Different tools address different parts of this problem.

## 5.2: Why LLM-as-Judge Fails

### The Concept

"LLM-as-Judge" uses one LLM to evaluate another:

```python
# Typical LLM-as-Judge pattern
def evaluate(response, criteria):
    prompt = f"""
    Rate this response on a scale of 1-10:
    Response: {response}
    Criteria: {criteria}
    """
    return gpt4(prompt)  # Returns "8/10"
```

### The Fatal Flaws

#### 1. Recursive Hallucination

If GPT-4 evaluates GPT-3.5, and both have the same biases...

```
User: "What's 17 × 24?"
GPT-3.5: "408" ❌ (Actual: 408... wait, that's right)
GPT-4 Judge: "Correct! 10/10" ✅

User: "What's 17 × 24 × 3?"  
GPT-3.5: "1,224" ✅
GPT-4 Judge: "Hmm, let me check... 17×24=408, 408×3=1,224. Correct! 10/10" ✅

User: "What's 1847 × 293?"
GPT-3.5: "541,571" ❌ (Actual: 541,171)
GPT-4 Judge: "That looks reasonable! 9/10" ❌ BUG!
```

**The judge can't catch errors it would make itself.**

#### 2. Position Bias

Research shows LLM judges favor responses based on **position**, not quality:

| Response Order | Preference |
|----------------|------------|
| A first, B second | Prefers A (60% of time) |
| B first, A second | Prefers B (60% of time) |

**The order matters more than the content.**

#### 3. Verbosity Bias

LLM judges prefer **longer** responses, regardless of accuracy:

```
Short Response: "The answer is 42."
Long Response: "After careful consideration of the underlying 
               mathematical principles and exploring various 
               approaches, I've determined that the answer is 43."

LLM Judge: "Long response is better—more thorough!" ❌
```

#### 4. Self-Enhancement Bias

GPT-4 prefers GPT-4 outputs. Claude prefers Claude outputs.

| Judge Model | Prefers Own Family |
|-------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | 67% preference for GPT models |
| Claude | 71% preference for Anthropic models |

#### 5. Non-Determinism

Same input, different outputs:

```python
for _ in range(5):
    score = gpt4_judge(response)
    print(score)

# Output:
# 8/10
# 7/10
# 9/10
# 8/10
# 7/10 (!)
```

**Which score is "correct"? None of them!**

### 🎯 Key Takeaway

> **"Using one probabilistic system to judge another is like having a drunk person check if another drunk person is sober."**

## 5.3: Beaver: Probabilistic Bounds

### The Concept

**Beaver** (Berkeley, 2024) is a clever approach that computes **probability bounds** on LLM constraint satisfaction.

Instead of asking "Is this correct?" it asks "What's the probability this is correct?"

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        BEAVER APPROACH                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│  1. Define constraint: "Output must be valid JSON"              │
│                                                                  │
│  2. Systematically explore token space:                         │
│     - Build token trie of possible outputs                      │
│     - Prune branches that violate constraints                   │
│     - Compute probability mass of valid branches                │
│                                                                  │
│  3. Output: "P(valid JSON) ≥ 87.3%"                            │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When Beaver Works Well

| Use Case | Beaver Fit |
|----------|------------|
| Format constraints (JSON, XML) | ✅ Excellent |
| Length constraints | ✅ Good |
| Keyword inclusion/exclusion | ✅ Good |
| **Mathematical correctness** | ❌ Can't verify |
| **Logical consistency** | ❌ Can't verify |
| **Factual accuracy** | ❌ Can't verify |

### The Limitation

Beaver can tell you: **"87% chance this is valid JSON"**

Beaver **cannot** tell you: **"This calculation is correct"**

```
Query: "What is 2+2?"
LLM Response: "5"

Beaver: "This response has 100% probability of being a number!" ✅
QWED: "This response is mathematically WRONG." ❌
```

### Beaver vs QWED

| Aspect | Beaver | QWED |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Output** | "87% likely correct" | "100% proven correct" |
| **Method** | Probability bounds | Mathematical proof |
| **Verifies** | Format/structure | Content/correctness |
| **Use case** | Risk assessment | Production deployment |

### 🎯 Key Takeaway

> **"Beaver tells you probability. QWED tells you truth."**

## 5.4: QWED: Solver-as-a-Judge

### The Philosophy

QWED replaces neural network opinions with **mathematical proof**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                  │
│   LLM-as-Judge:    GPT-4  →  "This looks right"  (opinion)     │
│                                                                  │
│   Solver-as-Judge: SymPy  →  "2+2=4 ✓"           (proof)       │
│                    Z3     →  "Valid ∀x"          (theorem)     │
│                    AST    →  "No injection"      (analysis)    │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The 8 Specialized Engines

QWED doesn't use one tool for everything. It uses **specialized solvers**:

| Engine | Solver | Domain |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 🧮 **Math** | SymPy | Arithmetic, calculus, algebra |
| 🧠 **Logic** | Z3 | Propositional logic, quantifiers |
| 🛡️ **SQL** | SQLGlot | Query safety, injection detection |
| 📊 **Stats** | Sandbox | Statistical computations |
| ✅ **Facts** | TF-IDF + Entity Match | Claim verification |
| 🔐 **Code** | AST Analysis | Security vulnerabilities |
| 🖼️ **Image** | Metadata + VLM | Visual claims |
| 🤖 **Reasoning** | Multi-provider | Chain-of-thought |

### The Untrusted Translator Pattern

```python
from qwed_sdk import QWEDLocal

# LLM translates natural language → symbolic
# QWED verifies symbolically → proof

client = QWEDLocal(provider="openai")

# User asks in natural language
result = client.verify_math("Is 17*24 equal to 408?")

# QWED internally:
# 1. LLM translates: "17*24 == 408"
# 2. SymPy evaluates: 17*24 = 408 ✓
# 3. Returns: verified=True, proof="17*24 = 408"

print(result.verified)  # True (PROVEN, not guessed)
```

### Why It Works

| LLM Weakness | QWED Solution |
|--------------|---------------|
| Can't compute | SymPy computes exactly |
| Can't prove | Z3 proves formally |
| Makes parsing errors | AST parses correctly |
| Has biases | Solvers have no opinions |
| Non-deterministic | 100% reproducible |

### 🎯 Key Takeaway

> **"QWED uses the LLM for what it's good at (translation) and solvers for what they're good at (computation)."**

### Recommendation Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Tool |
|----------|------------------|
| Block toxic content | Guardrails |
| Rate essay quality | LLM-as-Judge (with caveats) |
| Assess format compliance probability | Beaver |
| **Verify calculations** | **QWED** |
| **Verify logic** | **QWED** |
| **Verify code safety** | **QWED** |
| **Verify SQL queries** | **QWED** |
| **Enterprise compliance** | **QWED** |

### Hybrid Approach

In production, you often need multiple tools:

```python
def production_pipeline(llm_response):
    # Layer 1: Safety (Guardrails)
    if not guardrails.is_safe(llm_response):
        return "Blocked: Safety violation"
    
    # Layer 2: Format (Beaver, optional)
    if beaver.json_probability(llm_response) < 0.95:
        return "Warning: Format uncertain"
    
    # Layer 3: Correctness (QWED)
    result = qwed.verify(llm_response)
    if not result.verified:
        return f"Error: {result.error}"
    
    return result.value  # Proven correct!
```

### 🎯 Key Takeaway

> **"Guardrails for safety, Beaver for probability, QWED for truth."**

---

## 🧪 Exercise: Compare the Approaches

Try this verification task with different tools:

**Claim:** "The compound interest on $1000 at 5% for 3 years is $157.63"

### LLM-as-Judge Approach
```python
# Ask GPT-4 to verify
prompt = "Is this correct: compound interest on $1000 at 5% for 3 years = $157.63?"
result = gpt4(prompt)
# Result: "Yes, that appears correct!" (BUT IS IT?)
```

### QWED Approach
```python
from qwed_sdk import QWEDLocal

client = QWEDLocal()
result = client.verify_math(
    "1000 * (1 + 0.05)^3 - 1000 == 157.63"
)
print(result.verified)       # True
print(result.computed_value) # 157.625 (close enough with rounding)
```

**Which one would you trust with real money?**
