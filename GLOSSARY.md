# 📖 Glossary: AI Verification for Humans

**Before diving into the course, let's learn the language of verification - without the PhD jargon!**

This glossary translates scary technical terms into plain English with real-world analogies.

---

## Core Concepts

### Deterministic

**Scary Definition:** A system that always produces the same output for the same input.

**Simple Meaning:** Always gives the same answer (2+2=4, every single time).

**Real-World Analogy:** 
- **Calculator** 🧮 - Press "2+2" and you always get "4"
- **Traffic Light Rules** - Red always means stop, green always means go
- **Recipe with Measurements** - 1 cup flour is always 1 cup, not "about a cup"

**Why It Matters:** Bank transfers, medical dosages, and tax calculations need determinism!

---

### Probabilistic

**Scary Definition:** A system that uses statistical patterns to generate outputs.

**Simple Meaning:** Probably gives the right answer, but it can change.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Human Guess** 🤔 - "I think 2+2 is... 4? Yeah, probably."
- **Weather Forecast** - "70% chance of rain" (might or might not rain)
- **Autocorrect** - Sometimes fixes "teh" to "the", sometimes doesn't

**Why LLMs are Probabilistic:** They predict the next word based on patterns, not facts!

---

### Hallucination

**Scary Definition:** When an AI generates plausible but incorrect information.

**Simple Meaning:** When AI lies confidently.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Student Making Up Answers** - Sounds smart, totally wrong
- **Confident Liar** - Says "Trust me" but has no idea
- **Dream Logic** - Feels real while happening, nonsense when you wake up

**Example:**
```
User: "Who was the first person on Mars?"
LLM: "Neil Armstrong, in 1969." ❌ (Sounds plausible, completely false)
```

---

## Technical Terms (Simplified)

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

**Scary Definition:** A tree representation of code structure.

**Simple Meaning:** Looking at code structure without running it.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Grammar Check** - Spell-check finds "their/they're" errors without understanding the essay
- **Blueprint** - See building structure before construction
- **X-Ray** - See bones without surgery

**What QWED Does:** Checks if code has `eval()` or `exec()` by reading its structure.

---

### Solver (Z3 / SymPy)

**Scary Definition:** Automated theorem prover using satisfiability modulo theories.

**Simple Meaning:** A tool that proves logic/math is correct, mathematically.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Impartial Judge** 👨‍⚖️ - Checks if arguments follow the rules
- **Fact Checker** - Verifies claims against evidence
- **Referee** - Ensures players follow game rules

**What It Does:**
```python
# You say: "If all A are B, and x is A, is x B?"
# Z3 proves: YES (always, mathematically certain)
```

---

### LLM-as-a-Judge

**Scary Definition:** Using one language model to evaluate another's outputs.

**Simple Meaning:** Asking an AI to check another AI.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Grading Your Own Homework** - Obviously flawed
- **Fox Guarding Henhouse** - Conflict of interest
- **Two Drunk Friends** - "Are you sober?" "Yeah, you?"

**Why It Fails:** Both LLMs trained on same (wrong) internet data!

---

### Solver-as-a-Judge (QWED)

**Scary Definition:** Using mathematical solvers instead of LLMs to verify correctness.

**Simple Meaning:** Math proving answers, not AI guessing.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Calculator vs Human** - Calculator always right for math
- **Breathalyzer vs Asking** - Scientific test, not opinion
- **GPS vs Directions** - Satellite precision, not memory

**Why It Works:** SymPy and Z3 are deterministic - they compute, not guess.

---

### Lossy Compression (The JPEG Analogy)

**Scary Definition:** Data compression that discards some information.

**Simple Meaning:** Making things smaller by throwing away details.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **JPEG vs RAW Photo** - JPEG loses pixels, RAW keeps them all
- **Summary vs Book** - Summary loses details
- **LLM vs Internet** - LLM "compresses" knowledge, loses precision

**Why It Matters:** LLMs are lossy compression of the web - they lose facts!

---

### Probabilistic Gap

**Scary Definition:** The asymptotic limit of accuracy in gradient-based learning.

**Simple Meaning:** AI can never reach 100% accuracy, no matter how much training.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Diminishing Returns** - More training = smaller gains
- **Asymptote** - Gets closer but never touches the line
- **"Good Enough"** - 99.9% sounds great until it's 1 error per 1000

**Key Insight:** You can't fine-tune your way to determinism!

---

### Beaver (Probabilistic Verifier)

**Scary Definition:** Framework for computing probability bounds on LLM constraint satisfaction.

**Simple Meaning:** Tool that tells you "how likely" output is correct.

**Comparison with QWED:**
- **Beaver:** "87% likely correct"
- **QWED:** "100% proven correct"

**When to Use:** Risk assessment, not production verification.

---

### Guardrails

**Scary Definition:** Rule-based filters that block unsafe AI outputs.

**Simple Meaning:** Safety filters that say "STOP" or "GO".

**Comparison with QWED:**
- **Guardrails:** Safety (is it harmful?)
- **QWED:** Correctness (is it right?)

**Analogy:** Guardrails = Seatbelts, QWED = Crash Test.

---

## Verification Concepts

### Symbolic Reasoning

**Scary Definition:** Manipulation of mathematical symbols according to formal rules.

**Simple Meaning:** Using math rules (not guessing) to get answers.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Following a Recipe Exactly** - Not "eyeballing" ingredients
- **Solving Algebra** - Step-by-step, provable
- **Chess Computer** - Calculates all moves, doesn't "feel" the best one

**Example:**
```python
# Symbolic (SymPy):
derivative = sp.diff(x**2, x)  # Always: 2*x (proven)

# Probabilistic (LLM):
"The derivative is probably... 2x? Or maybe x^2..." ❌
```

---

### Neurosymbolic AI

**Scary Definition:** Integration of neural networks with symbolic AI.

**Simple Meaning:** Combining "creative AI" with "precise math."

**Real-World Analogy:**
- **Artist + Accountant** - Artist creates, accountant verifies the numbers
- **Chef + Nutritionist** - Chef makes food, nutritionist checks calories
- **Poet + Spell Checker** - Poet writes, spell checker fixes grammar

**How QWED Uses It:**
1. **Neural (LLM):** Translates "Calculate interest" → Math formula
2. **Symbolic (SymPy):** Proves formula is correct

---

## Common Misconceptions

### "LLMs can do math if I prompt well"

**Reality:** No. LLMs predict text patterns, not calculate.

**Analogy:** Teaching a parrot to say "2+2=4" doesn't mean it understands math.

---

### "100% accuracy is impossible"

**Reality:** It IS possible in mathematically verifiable domains!

**Analogy:** Calculators have 100% accuracy for arithmetic. We can too (for math/logic/code).

**Caveat:** QWED can't verify creative writing or subjective opinions - only things with "correct answers."

---

### "More AI = Better Verification"

**Reality:** More AI = More probabilistic uncertainty.

**Analogy:** Asking 10 people who are all wrong doesn't make them right.

**Better:** Use deterministic tools (calculators, solvers) - not more AI.
