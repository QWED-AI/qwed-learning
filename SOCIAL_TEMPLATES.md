### Thread Starter (Hook)

```
🎓 I just launched a FREE course on AI Verification

Stop building "Vibe-Based" AI.
Start building "Fact-Based" AI.

RAG gives you context.
QWED gives you correctness.

1/ LLMs are great at sounding smart.
They're terrible at being right.

73% accuracy on finance tasks.
$12,889 errors in production.
Fake legal citations.

Problem: We're treating Artists like Accountants.

2/ Think of it this way:

🎨 LLMs = Artists
- Creative, convincing
- Great at writing
- Bad at math

🧮 QWED = Accountant  
- Boring, strict
- Terrible at poetry
- Never wrong at numbers

Don't ask an artist to do your taxes!

3/ The course teaches you:

✅ Why hallucinations are inevitable
✅ How neurosymbolic AI catches 100% of errors*
✅ Production patterns (PII masking, error handling)
✅ LangChain integration

*in verifiable domains (math/logic/code)

4/ Best part: It's FREE and takes 3 hours.

5 modules + hands-on examples + capstone project.

Build a portfolio piece you can show employers.

🎓 Announcing: Free Course on AI Verification

After seeing too many AI projects fail in production due to hallucinations, I decided to create a comprehensive course on verification techniques.

Why this matters:
• 73% accuracy on financial calculations (Claude Opus benchmark)
• $12,889 production bugs from unverified AI
• Lawyers sanctioned for fake citations

The problem: We're treating probabilistic systems (LLMs) like deterministic ones (calculators).

The solution: Neurosymbolic verification. Use LLMs for creativity, deterministic engines for correctness.

What you'll learn:
✅ Why hallucinations are a feature, not a bug
✅ Artist vs. Accountant: When to use which
✅ Production patterns (PII masking, HIPAA compliance)
✅ LangChain/LlamaIndex integration
✅ Build a verified RAG chatbot (portfolio piece)

Time: 3 hours
Cost: Free (CC0 license)
Level: Beginner to Advanced

Perfect for:
→ Developers integrating LLMs
→ ML engineers building AI products
→ Tech leads evaluating AI safety

Course: https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-learning

Stop trusting Auto-Correct with your money. Learn verification.

### LinkedIn (Short Announcement)

```
🚀 Just launched a free course on AI Verification

Learn how to catch LLM hallucinations BEFORE they reach production.

The core concept: LLMs are Artists (creative), QWED is the Accountant (precise).

Course includes:
• 5 modules (3 hours)
• Production code examples
• Capstone project for your portfolio

[P] Free Course: AI Verification for Production Systems

Hey r/MachineLearning,

I've built a free course on neurosymbolic verification for LLM outputs. After seeing too many production bugs from hallucinations (including a $12,889 error at my company), I wanted to teach the patterns we use to ship reliable AI.

What's covered:
- Why hallucinations happen (probabilistic vs deterministic systems)
- How symbolic engines provide mathematical proofs
- Production patterns (retry, fallback, PII masking, audit logs)
- Framework integration (LangChain, LlamaIndex)
- Capstone project: Build a verified RAG chatbot

Course: https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-learning
License: CC0 (public domain)
Time: ~3 hours

The approach: Use LLMs to translate natural language → symbolic code, then use deterministic engines (SymPy, Z3, AST) to verify correctness.

Feedback welcome!
```

### Hacker News

```
Show HN: Free course on AI verification for production systems

After seeing production bugs from LLM hallucinations (including a $12,889 calculation error), I created a course teaching neurosymbolic verification.

Core idea: LLMs are great translators (English → Math), terrible calculators. So we use them for translation, then verify with SymPy/Z3/AST.

Course includes real examples:
- Healthcare: Units confusion (mg vs g, 1000x overdose)
- E-commerce: Hallucinated discounts ($500K revenue saved)
- Finance: Loan calculations with audit trails

5 modules, 3 hours, CC0 license: https://github.com/QWED-AI/qwed-learning

Feedback appreciated!

## Dev.to Article Template

```markdown
# Stop Trusting Auto-Correct with Your Money: A Free Course on AI Verification

## The Problem

Everyone's building LLM-powered apps. Few are verifying the outputs.

Result: 73% accuracy on finance tasks, $12,889 bugs in production, and lawyers getting sanctioned for fake citations.

## The Core Insight

LLMs are **Artists**, not **Accountants**.

🎨 Artists:
- Creative and convincing
- Great at writing and brainstorming
- Bad at precise calculations

🧮 Accountants:
- Boring and strict
- Terrible at creativity
- Never make math mistakes

**Don't ask an artist to do your taxes.**

## The Solution

Neurosymbolic AI: Use LLMs for translation, symbolic engines for verification.

```python
# LLM translates English to Math
"Calculate 15% of $200" → "200 * 0.15"

# SymPy verifies the calculation
verify_math("200 * 0.15") → 30.0 ✅
```
